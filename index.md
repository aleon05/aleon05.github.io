## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 5 Part 2

This lab was fun, we used the real life application of decimal feet to feet and inches. I had to refresh my memory of conversions which I liked of 12 inches to every foot and 8 eighth of an inch in every inch. Once we figured out the basics, we used the if statements to calculate the area. 

Lab 7 Part 1

This comes in second as for favorite labs, because it was the application of bools for a pretty realistic function. The idea of creating a system that knew when parking is allowed is pretty interesting for me. Our code would return true if the time and day matched and false if it did not. The code would recognize if the parking time and day was allowed, followed by a message saying either invalid minute or day if parking was invalid. 

Lab 11

This was my favorite lab, I enjoyed all aspects of it and overall enjoyed it very much. For part 1, we analyzed given US States based off of their name, population, land area and population density with vectors. For part 2, we created a guessing game with a given secret number. I enjoyed the process of setting a secret number and follow up functions such as guess too big or guess too small.
